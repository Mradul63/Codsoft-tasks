            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>
                <li>IPL score prediction</li>
                The IPL score prediction model uses machine learning and historical match data to forecast Indian Premier League cricket match outcomes accurately. By preprocessing data, engineering features, and selecting the right model, it delivers valuable insights for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and fantasy players, enhancing sports analytics and decision-making.

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>
                <li>Stock market prediction</li>
                Stock market prediction involves forecasting future stock prices using various methods such as technical analysis, fundamental analysis, sentiment analysis, and machine learning. However, predicting stock markets with certainty is challenging due to numerous influencing factors, making it an informed assessment rather than a definite outcome. Investors should exercise caution and diversify their portfolios to manage risks effectively.
